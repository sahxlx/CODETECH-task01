**Overview of project
**Project-Create a Python program that acts as a basic calculator. It should prompt the user to
enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division). Then, it should perform the selected operation and display the result to the
user.


### Explanation:

1. **Functions for Operations**: 
   - `add(x, y)`: Adds two numbers `x` and `y`.
   - `subtract(x, y)`: Subtracts `y` from `x`.
   - `multiply(x, y)`: Multiplies `x` and `y`.
   - `divide(x, y)`: Divides `x` by `y`, handling division by zero.

2. **Main Function (`main()`)**:
   - Displays a welcome message and menu of operations.
   - Prompts the user to enter their choice of operation (`a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`).
   - Takes two numbers as input from the user.
   - Based on the user's choice, calls the corresponding function and prints the result.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - Converts user inputs to `float` to handle decimal inputs.
   - Validates the user's choice and handles invalid inputs gracefully.

4. **Execution**:
   - The program starts executing from `main()` function when `__name__` is `"__main__"`, ensuring it runs when the script is executed directly.

This program provides a basic framework for a calculator and can be expanded further with additional operations or error handling as needed.
